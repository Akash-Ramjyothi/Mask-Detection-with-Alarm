## 📜 Description:
Developed a Mask Detection AI System which makes use of an external camera and the detects if a subject is not wearing mask. Also when detected presence without mask, the system emmits an alert sound to notify.

## 🌳 Social-Welfare Usecase:
The Face Mask Detection System can be used at airports to detect travelers without masks. Face data of travelers can be captured in the system at the entrance. If a traveler is found to be without a face mask, their picture is sent to the airport authorities so that they could take quick action.
